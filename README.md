Tracking prices data for personal things I want to buy.

## Quick links

- [Nintendo](https://flatgithub.com/darcien/kapan_diskon?filename=prices%2Fnintendo.json&filters=&sha=a253fcf6a0f8e796a734fc91d4c82690b7bb847e&sort=name%2Casc&stickyColumnName=name&tab=productPrices)

## Why

Because these online shops does not notify me when there are sales.
I don't understand why they have wishlist and marketing emails but does not send email when there are sales.

## Inspiration

Heavily inspired by [git scraping article by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) and [flat data by Idan Gazit and co.](https://githubnext.com/projects/flat-data)
