## Why

Because these online shops does not notify me when there are sales.
I don't understand why they have wishlist and marketing emails but does not send email when there are sales.

## Inspiration

Heavily inspired by [git scraping article by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) and [flat data by Idan Gazit and co.](https://githubnext.com/projects/flat-data).
